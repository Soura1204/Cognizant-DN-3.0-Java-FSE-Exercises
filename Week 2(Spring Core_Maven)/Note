Spring Core is the foundational framework of the Spring ecosystem. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Key features include dependency injection (DI) and aspect-oriented programming (AOP). DI allows for loose coupling between components by managing their lifecycles and dependencies. AOP helps in separating cross-cutting concerns like logging and security. In a Spring Core Maven project, dependencies are managed through a `pom.xml` file, which simplifies version control and integration of third-party libraries. The Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container is central to Spring Core, responsible for managing the beans and their lifecycles.
